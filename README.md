# Titanic Data Explorer

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository contains a simple Shiny application that predicts the chance of surviving the Titanic disaster. The app is based on the Kaggle Titanic training dataset.

## Running the app

1. Ensure you have R with the packages `shiny`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `readr` installed. On Debian/Ubuntu you can install them with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y r-cran-shiny r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-dplyr r-cran-readr
   ```

2. Run the app from the repository directory with:
   ```bash
   R -e "shiny::runApp('app.R', port=3838, host='0.0.0.0')"
   ```

3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3838` to interact with the application.

The dataset `titanic_train.csv` was downloaded from the public Kaggle Titanic repository on GitHub.
=======
This repository provides a small Shiny app that predicts the survival probability for a hypothetical passenger on the Titanic. The model is trained on the `titanic_train` data from the CRAN package **titanic** and visualized with **ggplot2**.

## Installation

1. Install R (version 4 or newer).
2. Install the required packages:

```R
install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "titanic"))
```

## Usage

Start the application from R by running:

```R
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

A browser window will open where you can fill out ticket information (class, sex, age, etc.). The app then displays your estimated chance of survival and how it compares with the historical data.
